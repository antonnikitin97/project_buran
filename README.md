Files pertaining to my home-made Stream Deck project. 

## Motivation
I don't want to pay £150 for a stream deck

## Why Buran?
I decided some time ago to name all my personal projects after Russian space missions, буран (meaning, blizzard in Russian) was the Soviet Union's/Russia's attempt at a fully automated shuttle, it flew once successfully but was canned due to funding issues and the only existing model being destroyed.
